ElevenÂ American servicemen were in the plane when it went down in 1944.</p><p>According to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, after World War II there were around 79,000 Americans unaccounted for. Currently, there are more than 72,000 unaccounted for from World War II.</p><p>Many of those unaccounted for are thought to be resting throughout the world, which could be in the ocean, temporary cemeteries where fighting occurred or on the battlefield.</p><p>To help find soldiers whoâ€™ve gone missing in action, there are some organizations such as Project Recover, which helped find the B-24 bomber plane containing the 11 missing Americans.</p><p>â€œAfter 11 days on the water, and a search that covered nearly 27 square kilometers of the seafloor involving scanning sonars, high definition imagers, advanced diving and unmanned aerial and underwater robotic technologies, Project Recover located the debris field of the B-24 bomber in 213 feet of water,â€ said the Project Recover website.</p><p>2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, Jr. was one of the 11 men found and relative of Scott Althaus, director of the Cline Center for Advanced Social Research and professor in LAS.</p><p>Althaus worked closely with Project Recover to find what happened to his relative.</p><p>Even though the B-24 bomber plane was found in October 2017 by the Project Recover team, Althaus found out about it on March 30.</p><p>â€œOn that call, they told me pretty quickly that they found the plane and I was shocked because I just didnâ€™t expect that. For me and the Kelly family, I think that whole Easter weekend was a mix of exhilaration â€¦ but also, we really were grieving,â€ Althaus said. Â </p><p>The answer brought a lot of closure to him and his family since they did not expect to find the plane.</p><p>â€œThis is on the other side of the earth and is an extremely remote undeveloped area. The nearest dive resort is eight hours away by boat,â€ he said.</p><p>On Memorial Day in 2013, Althaus decided to investigate what happened to Kelly, his only relative missing in action, and his other family members that perished in World War II.</p><p>Throughout the past five years, he has periodically researched his family history concerning World War II, specifically focusing on the research around Memorial Day.</p><p>The move came from Althaus doing extensive academic research, which involved him entering statistical data of wartime casualties for his job.</p><p>â€œI started on the internet and with some newspaper databases that we had access to at the library and just did a name search on my relativeâ€™s name,â€ Althaus said.</p><p>His family began to help him conduct research and he started to receive help from different contacts that ranged from Belgium to Australia.</p><p>Many unexpected findings came from the research, such as finding the B-24 Bomber plane, as well as the kindness Althaus experienced from people.</p><p>â€œI think the biggest unexpected part of this was how generous complete strangers were to us time and time again in answering emails and suggesting steps we could take,â€ he said.</p><p>An example Althaus cites was when an expert told him a picture he had was not correct due to the paint job on the bomber plane. </p><p>Althaus recommends for other families to research what happened to their family members who went missing in action.</p><p>With Memorial Day coming up, Althaus will take time to remember his family who gave their lives to the war.</p><p>â€œMemorial Day is about remembering, reflecting those who have given their lives and service to our country and we can do much to honor those memories by sharing their stories; by remembering the lives that arenâ€™t here with us now,â€ Althaus said.</p><p>[emailÂ protected]</p><p></p>', ' May 28, 2018', 'storage/tennyson_crew_stateside2-900x706.jpg'),

The farmers market hosts visitors every Saturday beginning May 5 through October 27 from 7 a.m. to noon, rain or shine.</p><p>Since 1979, the Market at the Square has had an average of 80 vendors and over 3,500 visitors weekly, according to their website. However, this year, the market is home to 103 vendors including nitrogen-infused coffee, organic clothing artisans, hunger-fighting farmers and free nutrition programming for children.</p><p>University alumni Grant Garland and Will Newton, founders of NitroCup, offer visitors the chance to try their nitrogen brewed coffee every Saturday. At coffee shops, nitrogen-infused coffee is usually stored in a pressurized keg and poured from a tap, but for Newton and Garland, their shop is on a large tricycle. </p><p>NitroCupâ€™s second year has been off to a great start after a long winter, Garland and Newton said in an email.

The event is open to anyone, including those who have been affected by cancer. It will include multiple activities such as a short program, raffle and several outdoor events, Huntt said.</p><p> Catherine Schmid, recent graduate in LAS and vice president of the Illini 4000, said the reception will be held by the Cancer Center at Illinois.</p><p>â€œThe Cancer Center has wanted to host a reception for the Illini 4000 to welcome us back to campus. We have been currently working on a partnership with the Cancer Center and so with that, we are looking to be more involved next year with campus efforts and kind of connecting the campus community at Illinois,â€ Schmid said.</p><p>In years past, there have been events while the Illini 4000 cycling team has passed through campus, but this is the first year where there will be a reception hosted by the Cancer Center at Illinois.</p><p>There will be multiple people attending, possibly some who are coming from the ride along.Â A ride along is where people can choose to cycle from different starting or endpoints with the Illini 4000 team instead of cycling with them through the whole trip from New York City to San Francisco, Schmid said.</p><p>University Chancellor Robert Jones, Jim Moore, Jr., president and CEO of the Universtiy of Illinois Foundation and Barry Benson, viceÂ chancellor for advancement, are participating in the ride along with the Illini 4000 team.</p><p>â€œThis is kind of the first year we have done a ride along because the University administration has wanted to do it and we would like to have them involved as well,â€ Schmid said.</p><p>Alia Alsikafi, junior in LAS and director of marketing of Illini 4000, said there will be an opportunity to collect interviews for the Portraits Project during the reception.</p><p>The Portraits Project is an opportunity for people who have been affected by cancer to share their story through informal interviews and at the end of the trip, Illini 4000 makes a documentary of everyone they have met along the way, Alsikafi said.</p><p>â€œ(The Portraits Project) basically aims to document the cancer American experience across the country,â€ she said.</p><p>The College of Medicine also has a partnership and has been working closely with the Illini 4000. The Illini 4000 is hoping to help strengthen their connection with the College of Medicine through the reception, too.

(70, 'DRES to celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day', '<p>On Wednesday, a ceremony will be held by the Disability Resources and Educational ServicesÂ in Huff Hall and the Khan Annex to celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Activities will include hands-on workshops, exhibits and assistive technology demonstrations.</p><p>GAAD is an awareness day focusing on accessibility, often emphasizing web accessibility. It is marked annually on the third Thursday of May.</p><p>Christy Blew, an IT accessibility specialist in training and outreach for DRES, said DRES started to celebrate GAAD two years ago.</p><p>â€œLast year, we had a small open house. We knew last year that we really want to do something bigger this year,â€ Blew said.</p><p>Blew emphasized the importance of educating people on technical accessibility.</p><p>â€œItâ€™s an opportunity to bring awareness about accessibility and information technology. A lot of people think the world is accessible. They think of physical type things, like a ramp. But things for digital accessibility are still a little unfamiliar,â€ she said.</p><p>DRES will provide many activities with multiple ways to experience this education. For example, DRES will have representatives from Apple come in and talk about what the Mac system in computers can do with helping people with accessibility.</p><p>There will also be some sessions for accessibility on the Windows system.</p><p>â€œFor Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, somebody will talk about how you can make a word document by using styles to build your heading structure when you want to make a heading instead of making a big board â€¦ So when somebody uses technology like a screen reader, then it will read them itâ€™s a heading instead of just regular text,â€ Blew said.</p><p>These sessions and activities will not only focus on people with disabilities. People can also learn something from them to make their lives or people with disabilities lives easier.</p><p>â€œWe donâ€™t want to be to a specific audience; we want to be for everyone,â€ Blew said.</p><p>During lunch time, there will be an open house for participants to visit.</p><p>â€œFor the open house, we have some people for demonstrating some different software people might use,â€ Blew said.</p><p>The presenters come from diversified areas. Some will be from outside of the University, like Illinois Radio Reader, where they do audio recordings of newspapers and magazines for free.</p><p>People from the Illinois Department of Revenue will also be there to talk about a program they have to help the disabled with their finances. In total, there will be 15 different stations.</p><p>Audio description experience may be the most popular activity. This is a new technology designed for somebody who is blind.</p><p>â€œImagine you are watching a video and you close your eyes. Then, it will describe what is going on when people in the video are not talking,â€ Blew explained.</p><p>DRES is going to provide box lunches for people who registered. There will also be a shuttle bus service between locations for people who come late and need to be picked up. Free parking is also available and there will be volunteers to direct people and to give people help in classrooms.</p><p>â€œItâ€™s an opportunity to share something about the accessibility; the opportunity for people aside from us to join in. We do a lot of teaching and training. But there are so many people on campus and in the community area that are unfamiliar with accessibility,â€ Blew said.</p><p>[emailÂ protected]</p><p></p>', ' May 21, 2018', 'storage/IMG_4210-1333x1000.jpg'),
